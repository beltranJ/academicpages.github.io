## Recent Projects
**Google - Isolated Sign Language Recognition:**
- Objective: Develop a sign language recognition model for classifying sign video sequences.
- Result: Achieved a classification accuracy of 0.79 using a Transformer-based model architecture.
- Tools: TensorFlow Lite

**Google Research - Identify Contrails to Reduce Global Warming (in-work):**
- Objective: Train models to identify contrails from satellite images to prevent contrail formation.
- Methodology: To date, my approach has centered around the use of encoder-decoder architectures, utilizing RegNet as the encoder and architectures such as U-Net or DeepLabV3+ as the decoder. I have also experimented with vision transformers.
- Result: The most effective model I've created so far achieves a global dice coefficient of 0.58 on the test set.
- Tools: Pytorch, TPU
